## Overview

A 3D driving simulation game, based around the ['Buzzed Driving Is Drunk Driving' campaign](https://www.nhtsa.gov/campaign/buzzed-driving), which aims to inform people that "If you have to do something to make yourself okay to drive, youâ€™re not okay to drive."

The action takes place in a car in which two friends are heading home. However, the driver is 'buzzed' and therefore incapable of adequately controlling the vehicle. Because of that, the player will need to control the passenger's actions and constantly guide the driver in order to help him better control the vehicle and avoid crashing, while several life-threatening events take place.
